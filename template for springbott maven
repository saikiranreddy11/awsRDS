Angular Project Tasks
Identify the basic structure for the Angular project
Identify the package manager (npm/yarn) and set up dependencies
Configure angular.json and package.json
Validate the project setup from the Local VDI
Validate the project setup from the remote server
Set up environment-specific configurations (environment.ts)
Implement a GitHub Actions pipeline to build the Angular project
Develop a GitHub Actions pipeline to deploy the built project to a static hosting service (e.g., S3, Firebase Hosting, or GitHub Pages)
Implement a CI/CD pipeline for linting and unit testing using Jest/Karma
Implement a GitHub Actions pipeline to run end-to-end tests using Cypress
Research GitFlow/TBD - Document Approach
Write CI/CD pipelines for GitFlow/TBD
Inject GitFlow CI/CD into an existing Angular project template
Add a README.md to use this template
Planned Activities
Refine templates based on feedback/Discuss compatibility for all projects
Research GitHub OIDC setup
Node.js Project Tasks
Identify the basic structure for the Node.js project (Express/NestJS)
Identify the package manager (npm/yarn) and set up dependencies
Configure package.json and set up required scripts (start, build, test)
