5. Step-by-Step Deployment Process

A developer creates a feature/* branch from develop and implements changes.

The developer manually triggers the CI workflow to build and push the Docker image.

Once the feature is tested, it is merged into develop.

A release/* branch is created from develop for QA validation.

The release image is deployed to the QA environment using the deployment workflow.

If issues are found, a bugfix/* branch is created from the release branch and redeployed.

Once QA is complete, the same release branch is deployed to the staging environment.

After staging verification, the release branch is merged into main.

The main branch is deployed to the production environment.

If any production issues arise, a hotfix/* branch is created from main, and the fix is deployed.
