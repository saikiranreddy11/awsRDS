            sleep 15
          done

what are we doing here, can you explain clearly please ? why are we comparing with "$STATUS" == "COMPLETED" , "$STATUS" == "FAILED" .

now when I eun the aws ecs describe-services --cluster dgx-prism-use1-prd-ecs --services Prism --query "services[0].deployments[0].rolloutState" --output text, the output is COMPLETED . that does mean that the deployment is successfull right ? Iam confused

Explanation of the Code:
The script is a GitHub Actions step that continuously checks the deployment status of an ECS service until it either completes successfully or fails and triggers a rollback.

Step-by-step breakdown:
Define ECS Cluster and Service Name:

sh
Copy
Edit
CLUSTER_NAME="dgx-prism-use1-prd-ecs"
SERVICE_NAME="${{ matrix.service }}"
CLUSTER_NAME: Defines the ECS cluster where the service is running.
SERVICE_NAME: Uses the matrix variable (from the workflow) to determine which service to check.
Start an infinite loop to monitor the deployment:

sh
Copy
Edit
while true; do
The loop will keep running until the deployment completes successfully or fails.
Fetch the rollout state of the current deployment:

sh
Copy
Edit
STATUS=$(aws ecs describe-services --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --services $SERVICE_NAME --query "services[0].deployments[0].rolloutState" --output text)
This AWS CLI command retrieves the rollout state of the deployment for the given ECS service.
The rolloutState can be one of:
COMPLETED ‚Üí Deployment was successful.
FAILED ‚Üí Deployment failed, rollback triggered.
Other intermediate states (e.g., IN_PROGRESS) ‚Üí Deployment is still ongoing.
Check the deployment status:

sh
Copy
Edit
if [ "$STATUS" == "COMPLETED" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Deployment succeeded"
    break
elif [ "$STATUS" == "FAILED" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Deployment failed, rollback triggered!"
    exit 1
fi
If STATUS is COMPLETED, it prints ‚úÖ "Deployment succeeded" and exits the loop.
If STATUS is FAILED, it prints ‚ùå "Deployment failed, rollback triggered!" and exits with an error (exit 1) to fail the pipeline.
If the deployment is still ongoing, it prints "‚è≥ Waiting for deployment to complete...".
Wait before checking again:

sh
Copy
Edit
sleep 15
The script waits for 15 seconds before checking again to avoid excessive API calls.
Answer to Your Question:
When you run:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws ecs describe-services --cluster dgx-prism-use1-prd-ecs --services Prism --query "services[0].deployments[0].rolloutState" --output text
and the output is:

nginx
Copy
Edit
COMPLETED
it does mean that the deployment was successful ‚úÖ.

Why Are We Checking COMPLETED and FAILED?
COMPLETED ‚Üí Confirms that the new task definition was successfully deployed and is now running.
FAILED ‚Üí Indicates that ECS encountered an error, triggered a rollback, and restored the previous working task definition.
Additional Notes:
If the rollback was successful, the rolloutState might also return COMPLETED, but it would indicate that it reverted to the previous version, not that the new version worked.
To check if the rollback happened, you can compare the task definition ARN before and after the deployment.
Would you like a script to verify if a rollback happened by comparing the task definitions before and after the deployment? üöÄ

can I see teh roll out state in the console ? for the prism service it has to be FAILED right as the rollback is triggered 
ChatGPT said:
Can You See rolloutState in the AWS Console?
Yes, you can check the rolloutState of your ECS service deployment in the AWS Console by following these steps:

Steps to View Rollout State in AWS Console:
Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to ECS (Elastic Container Service).
Select your ECS Cluster ‚Üí dgx-prism-use1-prd-ecs.
Click on Services ‚Üí Find the Prism service.
Go to the "Deployments" tab.
Check the "Status" and "Rollout State" of the ongoing deployment.
Should Rollout State be FAILED if Rollback Was Triggered?
Not necessarily. If the rollback completed successfully, the final rolloutState will show as COMPLETED, even if the new deployment failed.

If Deployment Fails & Rollback Begins: rolloutState = FAILED
If Rollback Completes Successfully: rolloutState = COMPLETED (but with the old task definition)
If Deployment is Still Ongoing: rolloutState = IN_PROGRESS
How to Confirm If a Rollback Happened?
Since rolloutState shows COMPLETED, you need to verify if a rollback happened by checking which task definition is running.

Check the Currently Active Task Definition via Console:
Go to ECS > Clusters > dgx-prism-use1-prd-ecs.
Click on Services > Prism.
In the "Deployments" tab, look for:
The Task Definition ARN (it should match a previous version if rollback happened).
If there was a failed deployment attempt.
Check via CLI:
Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws ecs describe-services --cluster dgx-prism-use1-prd-ecs --services Prism --query "services[0].taskDefinition" --output text
If this shows an older task definition ARN (instead of the latest one you deployed), then rollback was triggered and completed.
Next Steps:
‚úÖ If rolloutState shows COMPLETED, but the task definition is old, rollback succeeded.
‚ùå If rolloutState is still FAILED, the rollback might not have worked.
üîç Compare current vs. previous task definition ARN to confirm rollback.
Would you like a script to automatically check if a rollback happened? üöÄ

You said:
is that means that 

if the deployment is successfil teh rollout status is COMPLETED directly and teh deployment is successfill , 
But if the deplyment is failed , teh rollout status is changed to FAILED first (we have to detect when the status failed and mark the deploymet as fail ?) and then eventually it changed to COMPLTED when teh rollback is complted it then points to the previous inactive stable version right ? and from there we have to handle by activating gthe inactive taskdef right ?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, your understanding is almost correct! Let me clarify step-by-step:

Behavior of rolloutState in ECS Deployments
The rolloutState changes depending on whether the deployment succeeds or fails. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

‚úÖ If the Deployment is Successful:
ECS starts deploying the new task definition.
rolloutState = IN_PROGRESS while deploying.
If deployment passes health checks and runs successfully:
rolloutState = COMPLETED (Deployment is successful).
The service runs the new task definition successfully.
‚úÖ Final state: Deployment is successful, and the rolloutState is COMPLETED.

‚ùå If the Deployment Fails (Rollback Happens):
ECS starts deploying the new task definition.
rolloutState = IN_PROGRESS while deploying.
Deployment fails due to health check failures, incorrect configurations, etc.
rolloutState = FAILED (‚ö†Ô∏è At this point, rollback has not yet started).
Rollback is triggered automatically (if rollback is enabled).
ECS starts reverting to the previous stable task definition.
When rollback is finished, the rolloutState changes to COMPLETED.
The service is now running the previous stable task definition.
‚ùå Final state: Deployment failed, rollback completed, but ECS points to the previous (inactive) task definition.

Key Takeaways
‚úî Yes, after a failed deployment, rolloutState first changes to FAILED, then later to COMPLETED after rollback.

‚úî Yes, after rollback, ECS reverts to the previous stable task definition, but it remains inactive.

‚úî Yes, you need to handle re-registering the inactive task definition manually if necessary.

How to Handle This in Automation (CI/CD Pipeline)
Detect Deployment Failure:
Modify your pipeline to check when rolloutState = FAILED, so the pipeline knows the deployment failed.

Rollback Detection:
If rolloutState changes from FAILED ‚Üí COMPLETED, then a rollback happened.

Re-register the Previous Task Definition:

Retrieve the previous task definition ARN using:
sh
Copy
Edit
aws ecs list-task-definitions --status INACTIVE --sort DESC --family-prefix <SERVICE_NAME>
Re-register it using:
sh
Copy
Edit
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://taskdef.json
Update the service to use the stable task definition:
sh
Copy
Edit
aws ecs update-service --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> --service <SERVICE_NAME> --task-definition <TASK_DEF_ARN>
How Should Your Pipeline Handle This?
Modify Your ECS Deployment Step
Instead of marking deployment as successful just because rolloutState = COMPLETED, modify it to check if rollback happened.

Example Script (Modify Your CI/CD Pipeline)
sh
Copy
Edit
CLUSTER_NAME="dgx-prism-use1-prd-ecs"
SERVICE_NAME="Prism"

while true; do
  STATUS=$(aws ecs describe-services --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --services $SERVICE_NAME --query "services[0].deployments[0].rolloutState" --output text)
  
  if [ "$STATUS" == "COMPLETED" ]; then
    # Check if rollback happened (detect by checking if the task definition is inactive)
    CURRENT_TASK_DEF=$(aws ecs describe-services --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --services $SERVICE_NAME --query "services[0].taskDefinition" --output text)
    TASK_DEF_STATUS=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition $CURRENT_TASK_DEF --query "taskDefinition.status" --output text)

    if [ "$TASK_DEF_STATUS" == "INACTIVE" ]; then
      echo "‚ö† Rollback completed! The service is running an older task definition."
      echo "‚ùå Deployment failed, but rollback succeeded."
      exit 1
    else
      echo "‚úÖ Deployment successful."
      break
    fi
  elif [ "$STATUS" == "FAILED" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Deployment failed, rollback triggered!"
    exit 1
  fi

  echo "‚è≥ Waiting for deployment to complete..."
  sleep 15
done
Final Answer
Yes, rolloutState changes from FAILED ‚Üí COMPLETED when rollback is done.
Yes, after rollback, ECS reverts to the last stable task definition, which might be INACTIVE.
You need to handle re-registering the inactive task definition manually or via a script.
Modify your pipeline to detect rollback and handle task definition re-registration.
